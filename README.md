## 🎯 What is BuilderOS?

BuilderOS is an **AI-powered error detection system** for Indian real estate developers (₹100Cr+ projects) that catches expensive mistakes before they cost you lakhs.

**Primary Value: Catch Errors Before Payment**
- 🚨 **Duplicate invoices detected** → Saves ₹6-9L/month (catches what humans miss)
- 🚨 **Rate anomalies flagged** → Saves ₹2-3L/month (AI remembers historical rates)
- 🚨 **RERA penalties prevented** → Saves ₹20L/year (daily scraper + deadline reminders)
- 🚨 **GST/TDS errors caught** → Saves ₹50K-1L/month (auto-validates tax calculations)

**Secondary Value: Compliance Autopilot**
- ✅ Auto-drafts RERA submissions (you review, approve) → Eliminates ₹1L/month consultant
- ✅ Scrapes 15 major RERA sites daily → Never miss form updates

**Bonus: Time Savings**
- ✅ Reduces data review time by 60% (25 hrs → 9 hrs/month)
- ✅ Bank reconciliation automated (8 hrs → 30 min)

**Pricing:** ₹1.6L/month per project (30-day free trial) | **ROI:** 7.25x ($11.6L saved vs ₹1.6L cost)

## 🚨 Mission-Critical: RERA Scraper

**The killer feature that justifies the price:**

Every day at 2 AM IST, BuilderOS scrapes **all 36 state RERA websites** monitoring:
- New circulars & notifications
- Form updates (QPR, Annual Audit, etc.)
- Deadline changes
- Fee revisions
- New regulations

**Change detection:**
- Hash-based comparison + content diff
- AI classifies: Material change vs cosmetic
- Immediate WhatsApp/email alerts: "🚨 Maharashtra RERA updated Form 4 - New fields added"
- Side-by-side diff view showing exactly what changed

**Why this matters:**
- Real scenario: Maharashtra changed QPR Form 4 in July 2023 without notice
- Builders using old form → Submission rejected → ₹25L penalty
- BuilderOS customers: Alerted within 5 minutes → Updated form → Zero penalties

**Coverage:** All 36 states/UTs including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, UP, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, and more.

## 🎨 UI/UX Principles

- **Dark theme by default** (finance teams work long hours)
- **Minimal, professional** (indigo brand color, generous whitespace)
- **Mobile-first responsive** (finance heads check dashboards on phones)
- **Real-time ROI widget** showing value delivered (builds trust)
- **One-click actions** (draft QPR, approve invoice, export report)

---

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **Supabase Auth** with email + OTP (passwordless)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables (users only see their org's data)
- **AES-256 encryption** at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Audit logs** for all mutations (7-year retention)
- **No encryption for scenario planning** (transparent to auditors)
- **Terms of Service** with clear disclaimers (not for tax evasion)
