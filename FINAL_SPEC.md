---

## üöÄ Core Features (Detailed)

---

### **Feature 1: Cost Guard (AI Financial Intelligence)**

**Value:** ‚Çπ6-9L/month per project

#### **What It Does:**
Analyzes Tally/ERP data to catch financial errors before they cost lakhs:
- Duplicate invoice detection (catches what humans miss)
- Rate drift analysis (flags unusual price increases)
- GST/TDS error checking (prevents compliance issues)
- Cross-project intelligence (learns from all customer projects)
- Vendor performance tracking (identifies problem suppliers)

#### **How It Works:**

**Step 1: Data Import**
```
Builder uploads Tally CSV export (weekly/monthly)
Required columns:
- Date, Supplier, Amount, Invoice #, Item, GST, TDS, Payment Status

BuilderOS ingests ‚Üí Stores in project-scoped database
```

**Step 2: AI Analysis (Automatic)**
```
ü§ñ AI checks for:

1. DUPLICATE INVOICES (95% accuracy)
   - Same supplier + same amount + similar date
   - Same invoice number from same supplier
   - Fuzzy matching on supplier names (handles typos)

2. RATE DRIFT (85% accuracy)
   - Cement: Last 5 purchases at ‚Çπ520/bag, new one at ‚Çπ680/bag
   - AI flags: 31% increase (potential error or supplier gouging)
   - Cross-checks with customer's other projects

3. GST ERRORS (95% accuracy)
   - Invoice shows 18% GST on cement (wrong - should be 28%)
   - Cross-references official GST rates

4. TDS COMPLIANCE (95% accuracy)
   - Contractor payment > ‚Çπ30K without TDS deduction
   - Flags 194C violation

5. PAYMENT PATTERN ANOMALIES (80% accuracy)
   - You're paying suppliers 12 days early (giving free loans)
   - Invoice overdue 60+ days (penalty interest risk)

6. CROSS-PROJECT INTELLIGENCE
   - You paid UltraTech ‚Çπ505/bag in Project A last month
   - Now quoted ‚Çπ680/bag in Project B (35% higher)
   - AI flags discrepancy
```

#### **How It Works:**

**Component A: Automated RERA Monitoring**

```
Daily Scraping (2 AM IST):

For each state RERA website:
1. Puppeteer visits website
2. Extracts current content (forms, circulars, announcements)
3. Takes screenshot
4. Sends to Claude API:
   "Compare today's content vs yesterday's.
   Did anything change? If yes, what changed and why does it matter?"

If change detected:
5. Store in database
6. Analyze impact (which projects affected?)
7. Send alerts to affected builders
```

**Example Alert:**
```

### **Feature 3: Contract Analyzer**

**Value:** ‚Çπ10-20L/month amortized (prevents ‚Çπ1Cr+ disasters)

#### **What It Does:**
AI analyzes contracts in 60 seconds to catch risky clauses:
- Flags RERA compliance violations
- Detects unfair penalty clauses
- Identifies missing critical clauses (force majeure, insurance)
- Cross-checks with Indian legal cases (Indian Kanoon)
- Generates marked-up PDF with risk scores
- Suggests fixes and negotiation strategies

#### **How It Works:**

**Step 1: Upload Contract**
```
Builder uploads PDF (any contract type):
- Contractor agreements
- Supplier contracts
- Consultant agreements
- Lease agreements
- Loan documents

AI processes:
1. OCR extraction (if scanned)
2. Clause identification
3. Risk analysis
4. Legal case search
```

**Step 2: AI Analysis (60 seconds)**
```
AI analyzes contract against:

1. RERA Compliance Rules (live data from scraper)
   - Payment terms (30-day requirement)
   - Contractor licensing requirements
   - Insurance minimums

2. Indian Legal Cases (Indian Kanoon database)
   - Searches: "construction contract disputes [state] [year]"
   - Finds: Similar cases, judgments, penalties
   - Example: "34 builders lost disputes over force majeure in 2024"

3. Standard Contract Practices
   - Industry benchmarks (payment terms, penalties)
   - Customer's historical contracts (learns from past)
   - Red flags (unlimited liability, one-sided clauses)

4. Financial Risk Assessment
   - Calculates maximum exposure (penalties, liabilities)
   - Cross-checks with customer's financial capacity
   - Flags clauses that could bankrupt project
```

**Step 3: Risk Report**

**Cross-Project Intelligence:**

```
Example: Vendor pricing intelligence

Scenario:
Urban Risers has 3 projects, all using UltraTech cement.

Cost Guard analyzes across projects:
- Sunshine Heights: Paid ‚Çπ520/bag (3 months ago)
- Metro Plaza: Paid ‚Çπ505/bag (last month)
- Green Towers: Quote today ‚Çπ680/bag

Alert:
üö® CROSS-PROJECT ALERT - Green Towers

UltraTech cement quote: ‚Çπ680/bag (today)

Your pricing history (Urban Risers):
- Sunshine Heights: ‚Çπ520/bag (3 months ago)
- Metro Plaza: ‚Çπ505/bag (last month)
- Average: ‚Çπ512/bag

Current quote is 33% HIGHER than your average.

üí° ACTIONS:
1. Negotiate to ‚Çπ520/bag (show Metro Plaza invoice)
2. Switch to ACC Cement (‚Çπ495/bag in Metro Plaza)
3. Bulk order for all 3 projects (volume discount)

Potential savings: ‚Çπ2.1L on this order

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### **Risk 1: AI Accuracy Issues**

**Risk:** AI flags wrong duplicates, misses real ones, gives bad contract advice

**Impact:** Customer loses trust, churns, bad reviews

**Probability:** Medium (AI is 85-95% accurate, not 100%)

**Mitigation:**
- Always show confidence scores (95% = high confidence)
- Human-in-the-loop (builder approves before action)
- Clear disclaimers ("AI-generated, verify before signing")
- Positioning: AI assistant, not replacement
- Show proof (invoice numbers, amounts, dates)

---

### **Risk 2: RERA Scraper Breaking**

**Risk:** RERA website changes HTML, scraper breaks, misses critical update

**Impact:** Builder misses deadline, pays ‚Çπ20L penalty, sues us

**Probability:** Medium (websites change unpredictably)

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor scraper health daily (alerts if scraper fails)
- Manual fallback (if scraper fails, we manually check)
- Disclaimer: "We monitor daily, but YOU are responsible for compliance"
- Insurance: E&O insurance (‚Çπ1Cr coverage, ‚Çπ50K/year premium)
- 10 states = redundancy (one breaks, others work)

---

### **Risk 3: Builders Don't Trust AI**

**Risk:** "AI will make mistakes, I prefer human consultant"

**Impact:** Low adoption, slow sales

**Probability:** Medium (older builders, technophobia)

**Mitigation:**
- Demo with their real data (show ‚Çπ10L duplicate immediately)
- Focus on ROI, not AI ("We save you ‚Çπ17-30L/month")
- Positioning: "AI assistant + your judgment" (not full automation)
- Free trial (30 days, no credit card, low risk)
- Testimonials from other builders (social proof)

---

### **Risk 4: Competitors Copy (Fast Followers)**

**Risk:** After we prove market, competitors build same thing

**Impact:** Price competition, market share loss

**Probability:** High (software is easy to copy)

**Mitigation:**
- Speed (get to 50 customers fast, 12 months head start)
- Data moat (more customers = better cross-project intelligence)
- Network effects (vendor database improves with scale)
- Brand (first mover = "BuilderOS is the RERA compliance AI")
- Switching costs (uploaded 1000 docs, trained AI, high friction)
- Continuous innovation (add features faster than copycats)

---

### **Risk 5: Pricing Too High**

**Risk:** "‚Çπ1L/month too expensive, we'll use cheaper alternative"

**Impact:** Low conversion, slow growth

**Probability:** Low (ROI is 17-30x, defensible)

**Mitigation:**
- Prove ROI in demo (catch ‚Çπ10L duplicate live)
- Show vs alternatives (consultant ‚Çπ1L, we do more for ‚Çπ1L)
- Free trial (let them see savings before paying)
- Volume discounts (large customers pay less per project)
- Grandfather early customers (retention)
- If needed: Lower tier (‚Çπ60K/month, Cost Guard only)

---

### **Risk 6: Regulatory Changes**

**Risk:** Govt bans RERA scraping, changes laws, makes AI illegal

**Impact:** Product doesn't work, customers churn

**Probability:** Low (govt is pro-digital, pro-automation)

**Mitigation:**
- RERA scraping is public data (legal under IT Act)
- If banned: Work with RERA to get API access (or manual updates)
- Diversify features (even without RERA, Cost Guard still works)
- Pivot if needed (add more features, reduce RERA dependency)
