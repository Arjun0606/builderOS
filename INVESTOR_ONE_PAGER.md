# BuilderOS - One-Page Investment Summary

**AI-Powered Financial Intelligence for Indian Real Estate Developers**

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Indian builders manage ₹100-500 Cr projects and lose **₹50L-2Cr per project/year** due to:
- **Duplicate invoices** (100+ invoices/month, no automated detection)
- **RERA penalties** (₹50L-2Cr for missed deadlines/errors, 10 state websites to monitor)
- **Contract risks** (500-page agreements, hidden liability clauses)
- **Cash flow blindness** (multiple bank accounts, manual reconciliation)

**Current solution:** Excel + Tally + Manual labor → 60-70% error rate

---

## 💰 BUSINESS MODEL

**₹1L/month per RERA project** (includes 10 licenses)

**Why it works:**
- 10-20x ROI for customers (₹12L/year cost vs ₹50L-2Cr savings)
- Comparable to existing consultant fees (₹2-4L/year just for RERA)
- Low churn (if it prevents ONE penalty, it pays for itself 5-10x)

**Unit Economics:**
- ACV: ₹12L per project ($14.4K)
- LTV: ₹36-60L (3-5 year retention)
- CAC: ₹1-2L (referral-driven)
- LTV/CAC: 18-30x
- Gross margin: 85-90%
