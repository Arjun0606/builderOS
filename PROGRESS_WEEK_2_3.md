2. AI analyzes all invoices (30 seconds)
3. Flags duplicates, anomalies, errors
4. Shows exact amount at risk
5. One click to confirm or dismiss

**Value:**

- **Saves:** ₹6-9L/month per project (ongoing)
- **ROI:** Customer pays ₹1L/month, saves ₹10L+ immediately

**Example Alert:**

Invoice: SC/2025/1247
Confidence: 98%

This invoice was already paid on Oct 12, 2025

[Confirm Duplicate] [Mark False Positive]
```

**This ALONE justifies the ₹1L/month price!** ✅
