## Revenue Goal

**Target:** $70K/month by Month 10

### Math
- Price: $9.99/month
- Users needed: 7,007
- Conversion rate: 40% (free → paid)
- Free users needed: 17,518

### Path
- Month 2 (Launch): $8K MRR (800 paid)
- Month 4: $32K MRR (3,200 paid)
- Month 7: $50K MRR (5,000 paid)
- Month 10: $70K MRR (7,007 paid)

**Odds:** 70-75% if we execute well

---

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Progress Tracking** (no one else has this)
2. **Beautiful UI** (better than GitHub Copilot CLI)
3. **Works Everywhere** (any IDE, any terminal)
4. **Privacy-first** (local storage)
5. **Addictive** (dopamine from progress)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: GitHub Copilot improves CLI
**Mitigation:** Move fast, better UX, community

### Risk 2: Low adoption
**Mitigation:** Target college devs first, build in public

### Risk 3: High churn
**Mitigation:** Progress tracking makes it sticky

### Risk 4: AI costs too high
**Mitigation:** Smart caching, Gemini for cheap tasks

---

## Daily Goals

- **Day 1:** ✅ Foundation + basic commands
- **Day 2:** Polish commits + enhanced stats
- **Day 3:** Start autocomplete
