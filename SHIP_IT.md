## 🎯 **TARGET MARKET**

### **Primary:**
- College CS students (price-sensitive, social)
- Junior developers (want to look senior)
- Indie hackers (productivity-focused)

### **Secondary:**
- Senior developers (save time)
- Enterprise (teams, compliance)

### **Pain Points We Solve:**
1. ✅ Git is confusing
2. ✅ Commit messages are boring/hard
3. ✅ Can't use Cursor at work (company restrictions)
4. ✅ Want to track progress
5. ✅ Too proud to admit they need help

---

## 🔥 **WHY WE'LL WIN**

### **1. Git IS Hard**
- 95% of devs struggle with git
- Commit messages are an afterthought
- Everyone writes "fix" and "update"

### **2. Not Everyone Uses Cursor/Copilot**
- Enterprise restrictions
- Price ($10-20/month)
- IDE-locked
- **BuilderOS works everywhere**

### **3. Progress Tracking = Unique**
- No one else has this
- Addictive (don't want to lose stats)
- Shareable (viral on Twitter)

### **4. Freemium = Easy Growth**
- Free tier removes friction
- 10 commits = enough to fall in love
- Natural upgrade path

---

## 📈 **GROWTH STRATEGY**

### **Week 1: Soft Launch**
1. Publish to npm
2. Deploy landing page
3. Post on Twitter (personal)
4. Share in Discord servers

### **Week 2: Product Hunt**
1. Launch Tuesday 12:01 AM PT
2. Share in Slack groups
3. Reddit posts (value-first, not spammy)
4. Engage with every comment

### **Week 3: Content**
1. Twitter threads (how we built it)
2. Blog posts (make git easy)
3. YouTube video (demo)
4. Dev.to articles

### **Month 2-3: Scale**
1. College CS programs (student discount)
2. Dev influencers (free Pro)
3. Podcast appearances
4. Conference sponsorships (if revenue allows)

---

## 🛠️ **WHAT'S LEFT (OPTIONAL)**

These are NOT blockers for launch:

### **Payment Integration** (2 days)
- LemonSqueezy setup
- Automated license generation
- Webhook integration

**You can sell manually for now:**
1. Someone emails you
2. You generate a license key
3. They activate
4. Payment via PayPal/Stripe invoice

### **Cloud API** (1 week)
- Online license validation
- Multi-device sync
- Usage analytics

**Not needed yet. Local-first works great.**

### **Analytics Dashboard** (1 week)
- Track revenue
- User metrics
- Conversion rates

**Use Stripe/LemonSqueezy dashboard for now.**

**Everything except payments is done.**

**You can:**
1. Publish to npm TODAY
2. Deploy landing page TODAY
