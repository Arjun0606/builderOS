# BuilderOS - Investor Pitch Deck

**AI-Powered Financial Intelligence for Indian Real Estate Developers**

---

## üìä THE PROBLEM

Indian real estate builders manage **‚Çπ100-500 Cr projects** with massive financial complexity:

### **Pain Point #1: Financial Errors Cost Millions**
- 100+ invoices/month per project
- Duplicate payments = ‚Çπ10-20L losses per project/year
- No automated duplicate detection
- Manual reconciliation takes 50+ hours/month

### **Pain Point #2: RERA Compliance is a Nightmare**
- Quarterly Progress Reports (QPR) due every 90 days
- 10+ different state RERA websites to monitor
- Penalties for late/incorrect filings = ‚Çπ50L-2Cr per violation
- No automated monitoring of regulatory changes
- Consultants charge ‚Çπ50K-1L per QPR filing

### **Pain Point #3: Contract Risk Exposure**
- 20-30 contracts per project (contractors, suppliers, consultants)
- 50-500 page legal agreements
- Hidden liability clauses go unnoticed
- Legal reviews cost ‚Çπ1-2L per contract, take 2-4 weeks

### **The Current "Solution": Excel + Tally + Manual Labor**
- Finance teams manually check for duplicates (miss 60-70%)
- Legal teams read every page of contracts (slow, expensive)
- RERA compliance done by external consultants (‚Çπ2-4L/year)
- No AI, no automation, no intelligence layer

**Result:** Builders lose ‚Çπ50L-2Cr per project/year in avoidable errors, penalties, and inefficiencies.

## üéØ CORE FEATURES (DETAILED)

### **1. Cost Guard** üí∞
**Problem:** Duplicate invoices, incorrect GST rates, price anomalies  
**Solution:** AI-powered financial auditor that analyzes every rupee spent

#### **The Pain (Real-World Example):**
A Mumbai builder managing 3 projects with ‚Çπ100 Cr annual construction spend:
- 300-400 invoices per month across projects
- Finance team manually checks for duplicates in Excel (takes 40+ hours/month)
- Still misses 60-70% of duplicates due to human error
- **Lost ‚Çπ18L last year** to duplicate payments (6 invoices paid twice)
- **Paid ‚Çπ4L extra** due to GST calculation errors
- **Overpaid ‚Çπ8L** on materials (supplier price creep went unnoticed)
- **Total loss:** ‚Çπ30L/year from preventable errors

#### **How Cost Guard Works (Step-by-Step):**

**Step 1: Zero-Friction Data Import**
- Builder exports Tally data as CSV (File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Invoices)
- Drag & drop into BuilderOS (or auto-sync via API in future)
- No migration, no ERP replacement, works with ANY accounting system
- Upload frequency: Weekly (or daily for high-volume projects)

**Step 2: AI Analysis Engine (Runs in Real-Time)**

Our multi-layered detection system uses:

**A. Exact Duplicate Detection (100% accuracy)**
- Matches: Supplier name + Invoice number + Amount
- Example: "Shree Cement" + "INV-2024-1234" + "‚Çπ8.5L" appears twice
- Flags immediately with confidence score: 100%
- Action: Block payment, alert finance team

**B. Near-Duplicate Detection (85-95% accuracy)**
- Matches: Supplier + Similar amount (¬±5%) + Date proximity (¬±7 days)
- Example: 
  - Invoice 1: "Ultratech Cement" | ‚Çπ4.2L | March 15
  - Invoice 2: "Ultratech Cement" | ‚Çπ4.1L | March 18
- AI reasoning: "Same supplier, 2.4% price difference, 3 days apart - likely duplicate with rounding error"
- Flags with confidence score: 87%
- Action: Alert for manual review

**C. GST Rate Validation (India-specific)**
- Cross-references category against GST schedule
- Example flagged errors:
  - Cement invoice with 18% GST ‚Üí Should be 28% (‚Çπ2.5L underpaid to government)
  - Steel invoice with 12% GST ‚Üí Should be 18% (‚Çπ1.2L calculation error)
  - Labor invoice with 5% GST ‚Üí Should be 18% (contractor mistake)
- Includes historical GST rate changes (handles rate modifications over time)
- Action: Alert with correct rate, calculate discrepancy

**D. Price Anomaly Detection (Statistical Model)**
- Builds baseline from historical invoices (requires 3+ months of data)
- Calculates mean + standard deviation per category per supplier
- Flags outliers beyond 2 standard deviations
- Example:
  - Historical cement price: ‚Çπ380/bag ¬± ‚Çπ25 (from 50 invoices)
  - New invoice: ‚Çπ480/bag (4 std deviations above mean)
  - AI reasoning: "26% above historical average - possible data entry error or supplier overcharge"
- Flags with confidence score: 92%
- Includes seasonality adjustments (cement prices vary in monsoon)
- Action: Alert with price comparison chart

**E. Vendor Pattern Analysis**
- Tracks payment frequency per vendor
- Example:
  - Vendor "ABC Plumbing" typically bills monthly (‚Çπ2-3L per invoice)
  - Suddenly 4 invoices in same week (‚Çπ8L total)
  - AI flags: "Unusual billing pattern detected"
- Action: Alert for verification

**Step 3: Smart Dashboard & Alerts**

**Visual Interface:**
- Traffic light system (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Green: Clean invoices (90-95% of uploads)
  - Yellow: Possible issues (4-8% of uploads) ‚Üí Review recommended
  - Red: Critical flags (1-2% of uploads) ‚Üí Block payment

**Alert Types:**
- WhatsApp notification (instant): "üö® Critical: Duplicate invoice detected - ‚Çπ8.5L (Shree Cement)"
- Email digest (daily): "Summary: 45 invoices processed, 2 flagged, ‚Çπ12L saved"
- In-app notification: Click to see detailed analysis

**Step 4: Human-in-the-Loop Review**
- Finance manager reviews flagged invoices
- One-click actions:
  - "Confirm Duplicate" ‚Üí Marks as resolved, blocks payment
  - "False Positive" ‚Üí AI learns, improves future accuracy
  - "Needs Investigation" ‚Üí Assign to team member
- Audit trail: Who reviewed, when, what action taken

#### **Real Value (Customer Example):**

**Case Study: Shapoorji Pallonji-style Builder (‚Çπ500 Cr annual revenue)**

**Before BuilderOS:**
- Manual duplicate checking: 160 hours/month (4 people √ó 40 hours)
- Duplicate payments: 8 per year √ó ‚Çπ8L avg = ‚Çπ64L loss
- GST errors: 12 per year √ó ‚Çπ2L avg = ‚Çπ24L loss
- Price overcharges: ‚Çπ15L/year (went unnoticed)
- **Total cost:** ‚Çπ103L/year + 1,920 staff hours

**After BuilderOS (6 months):**
- AI checking: Automatic (0 manual hours for detection)
- Duplicates caught: 4 invoices = ‚Çπ32L saved
- GST errors caught: 6 invoices = ‚Çπ12L saved
- Price anomalies caught: 8 invoices = ‚Çπ18L saved
- **Total savings:** ‚Çπ62L in 6 months
- **Time saved:** 960 hours (finance team redeployed to strategic work)
- **BuilderOS cost:** ‚Çπ6L (6 months √ó ‚Çπ1L/month)
- **Net ROI:** ‚Çπ56L / ‚Çπ6L = **9.3x in 6 months**

#### **Technical Edge:**

**Why Our AI is Better Than Rules-Based Systems:**
- **Learns from patterns:** Adapts to each builder's specific vendors, pricing, workflow
- **Context-aware:** Understands "same day, same supplier = suspicious" vs "different day = normal"
- **Self-improving:** False positive rate drops from 15% ‚Üí 5% after 3 months of usage
- **India-specific:** Understands GST, TDS, RERA escrow accounts, vendor naming variations ("M/s ABC Pvt Ltd" = "ABC Pvt Ltd")

**Data Security:**
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
- Data never leaves India (hosted in Mumbai region)
- No third-party sharing
- SOC 2 compliant infrastructure

- **Time savings:** 120-160 hours per project/year
- **Error reduction:** 95% fewer duplicate payments
- **ROI:** 10-20x
- **Payback period:** 2-4 weeks

---

### **2. RERA Compliance AI** üìú
**Problem:** Builders get penalized for missing deadlines/rule changes  
**Solution:** AI-powered RERA monitoring + QPR automation - India's first automated compliance system

#### **The Pain (Real-World Example):**
A Bangalore builder with 5 Karnataka RERA projects:
- **Quarterly Progress Reports (QPR):** 5 projects √ó 4 quarters = 20 reports/year
- **Manual process:** Each QPR takes 8-12 hours (gather data, fill forms, verify)
- **Consultant fees:** ‚Çπ50K-1L per QPR √ó 20 = ‚Çπ10-20L/year
- **Penalty risk:** Missed ONE deadline last year (forgot QPR was due) = **‚Çπ50L penalty**
- **Time tracking:** Must monitor 10 different state RERA websites daily (impossible)
- **Rule changes:** No notification system - builder learns about changes weeks later
- **Total pain:** ‚Çπ60-70L/year + massive stress

#### **How RERA Compliance AI Works (Two-Part System):**

---

### **PART A: Daily RERA Monitoring (Automated Surveillance)**

**The Challenge:**
- 10 state RERA websites (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat, Kerala, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal)
- Each website has different structure, different update frequency
- Changes can happen anytime: New circulars, deadline extensions, form updates, penalty revisions
- No official notification system - builder must check manually every day
- **Current solution:** Hire someone to check daily = ‚Çπ30-40K/month + human error

**Our Solution:**

**Step 1: Intelligent Web Scraping (Not Traditional Scraping)**
- Uses **Playwright + Claude 4.5** (not basic HTML parsing)
- Why? RERA websites are dynamic, poorly structured, often change layout
- Traditional scrapers break when website changes ‚Üí Our AI adapts

**How it works (Technical):**
1. **Daily Crawl (3 AM IST):**
   - Playwright browser opens each RERA website
   - Takes screenshots + extracts all text content
   - Compares to yesterday's snapshot (MD5 hash comparison)

2. **Change Detection:**
   - If content hash changes ‚Üí AI investigates
   - Claude analyzes: "What changed? Is it important?"
   - Filters noise (footer updates, login issues) vs real changes (new circulars)

3. **AI Interpretation:**
   - Extracts key information:
     - **Deadline changes:** "QPR Q3 deadline extended from Dec 10 ‚Üí Dec 20"
     - **New circulars:** "Circular No. 45/2024 - New escrow withdrawal rules"
     - **Form updates:** "Form 4 revised - new fields added"
     - **Penalty updates:** "Late QPR penalty increased from ‚Çπ25K/day ‚Üí ‚Çπ50K/day"
   
4. **Impact Analysis:**
   - AI cross-references with builder's active projects
   - Example: "You have 3 Maharashtra projects ‚Üí This affects all 3"
   - Calculates urgency: "Critical" (deadline <7 days), "Important" (<30 days), "Info" (>30 days)

**Step 2: Smart Alerts (Multi-Channel)**

**WhatsApp (Instant - for critical changes):**
```
üö® RERA Alert - CRITICAL

Maharashtra RERA
QPR Q4 deadline: Dec 10 ‚Üí Dec 15 (5 days extension)

---

### **PART B: QPR Draft Generation (Auto-Fill Magic)**

**The Challenge:**
- QPR Form 4 (Maharashtra) has 50+ fields
- Requires data from: Tally (financials), site progress (engineer estimates), bank statements (escrow)
- Manual compilation: 6-8 hours per QPR
- Error-prone: One wrong number = rejection + penalties
- **Current solution:** Hire CA/consultant = ‚Çπ50K-1L per QPR

**Our Solution:**

**Step 1: Data Collection (One-Time Setup)**
- Builder provides:
  - Tally export (project-wise financial data)
  - Bank statement CSVs (escrow accounts)
  - Project milestones (foundation, structure, finishing, etc.)
  - Target completion date

**Step 2: AI-Powered Form Generation**

**For Maharashtra Form 4 (Example):**

**Section 1: Project Details** (Auto-filled from RERA registration)
- Project name, RERA ID, location, total units
- Source: Pulled from BuilderOS project database

**Section 2: Financial Status** (Auto-filled from Tally)
- Total project cost: ‚Çπ250 Cr
- Funds received from buyers: ‚Çπ180 Cr
- Funds in RERA escrow: ‚Çπ165 Cr
- Withdrawals from escrow: ‚Çπ85 Cr
- Balance in escrow: ‚Çπ80 Cr
- Source: Tally export + bank CSVs

**Section 3: Construction Progress** (Semi-automated)
- Physical progress: Builder inputs "72% complete"
- BuilderOS calculates:
  - Expected progress (based on timeline): 75%
  - Variance: -3% (slight delay)
  - Alert: "Progress 3% behind schedule"

**Section 4: Fund Utilization** (Auto-calculated)
- Total spent: ‚Çπ170 Cr
- Spent from escrow: ‚Çπ85 Cr
- Spent from other sources: ‚Çπ85 Cr
- Utilization rate: 85/165 = 51.5% (healthy)
- Compliance check: ‚úÖ "Within RERA limits"

**Section 5: Compliance Checklist** (Auto-verified)
- ‚úÖ Escrow account maintained
- ‚úÖ 70% of customer funds deposited
- ‚úÖ Withdrawals match construction progress
- ‚úÖ Engineer certificate attached
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Minor delay in project timeline" (flagged)

**Step 3: AI Quality Checks**
- Cross-verification:
  - "Funds received (‚Çπ180 Cr) = Sum of unit sales? ‚úÖ"
  - "Escrow withdrawals (‚Çπ85 Cr) ‚â§ 70% of expenses? ‚úÖ"
  - "Progress (72%) matches fund utilization (68%)? ‚úÖ"
- Red flags:
  - Escrow balance too low ‚Üí Alert
  - Progress behind schedule ‚Üí Alert
  - Missing documents ‚Üí Alert

**Step 4: Human Review + Submit**
- Builder receives draft QPR (pre-filled, PDF format)
- Reviews for accuracy (takes 15-30 mins vs 8 hours manual)
- Makes any corrections (AI learns from edits)
- Clicks "Approve" ‚Üí BuilderOS generates final PDF
- Builder signs digitally ‚Üí Submits to RERA portal

**State-Specific Formats:**
- Maharashtra: Form 4 (50 fields)
- Karnataka: Form QPR-1 (45 fields)
- Tamil Nadu: Progress Report Format (55 fields)
- Each state has different requirements ‚Üí BuilderOS adapts automatically

---

#### **Real Value (Customer Example):**

**Case Study: Godrej Properties-style Builder (8 projects across 3 states)**

**Before BuilderOS:**
- RERA monitoring: Hired intern (‚Çπ25K/month) to check websites daily
- Intern missed 1 deadline (was on leave) = **‚Çπ75L penalty** (Maharashtra)
- QPR preparation: 8 projects √ó 4 quarters √ó 8 hours = 256 hours/year
- Consultant fees: 32 QPRs √ó ‚Çπ75K = **‚Çπ24L/year**
- Stress: CFO constantly worried about missing deadlines
- **Total cost:** ‚Çπ99L/year (‚Çπ75L penalty + ‚Çπ24L consultant) + 256 staff hours

**After BuilderOS (12 months):**
- RERA monitoring: Automatic (0 manual hours)
- Missed deadlines: 0 (never miss again)
- QPR preparation: 8 projects √ó 4 quarters √ó 0.5 hours = 16 hours/year (AI does 95% of work)
- Consultant fees: ‚Çπ0 (eliminated)
- Penalties avoided: **‚Çπ75L**
- Time saved: 240 hours/year
- **BuilderOS cost:** ‚Çπ12L/year (8 projects √ó ‚Çπ1.5L average)
- **Net savings:** ‚Çπ87L/year (‚Çπ99L - ‚Çπ12L)
- **ROI:** 7.25x

**Bonus value:**
- Peace of mind (never worry about RERA again)
- Faster QPR turnaround (submit 2-3 weeks early, no last-minute rush)
- Compliance confidence (AI checks everything)

---

#### **Technical Edge:**

**Why Our Scraper Won't Break (Unlike Competitors):**

**Traditional Scrapers (fail rate: 30-40%):**
- Use XPath/CSS selectors ‚Üí Breaks when website changes layout
- Can't handle dynamic content (JavaScript-rendered pages)
- Can't interpret unstructured data (PDFs, images)

**BuilderOS AI Scraper (fail rate: <5%):**
- Uses Playwright (full browser automation) ‚Üí Works with any website
- Claude 4.5 interprets content ‚Üí Understands context, not just structure
- Adapts to layout changes ‚Üí "Find the QPR deadline on this page" (semantic understanding)
- Handles PDFs/images ‚Üí OCR + AI analysis
- Self-healing ‚Üí If scrape fails, AI tries alternative approach

**Example of AI Adaptation:**
```
Scenario: Maharashtra RERA website redesign (Oct 2024)

Traditional Scraper:
- Looks for <div class="qpr-deadline"> ‚Üí NOT FOUND ‚Üí BREAKS ‚ùå

BuilderOS AI:
- Screenshot page ‚Üí Analyze with Claude
- Prompt: "Find QPR deadlines on this Maharashtra RERA page"
- Claude: "I see a table with 'Form Type' and 'Last Date' columns. QPR Q3 deadline is Dec 10."
- Updates database ‚Üí No downtime ‚úÖ
```
