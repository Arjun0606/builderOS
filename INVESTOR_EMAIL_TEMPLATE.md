**Subject:** BuilderOS: AI for Indian Real Estate (YC-comparable, ‚Çπ50L-1Cr raise)

---

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm Arjun, and I've built **BuilderOS** - an AI-powered financial intelligence platform for Indian real estate developers.

**The Problem:**  
Builders managing ‚Çπ100-500 Cr projects lose **‚Çπ50L-2Cr per project/year** due to duplicate invoices, RERA penalties, and contract risks. Current solution: Excel + manual labor ‚Üí 60-70% error rate.

**Our Solution:**  
BuilderOS uses AI (Claude, Gemini) to analyze invoices, monitor RERA websites daily, review 500-page contracts, and consolidate cash flow - all without migrating from existing systems (Tally/Excel).

**Traction:**
- MVP deployed (builderos.in)
- 3 builder contacts lined up (15 projects = ‚Çπ15L/month potential)
- Demos scheduled for next 2 weeks
- Comparable to YC-funded companies: Triplezip ($500K), Bild.ai ($2M), Wayline ($1.2M)

**Market:**  
‚Çπ900 Cr TAM ($1B+) - 75,000+ projects across 25,000 Indian builders

**Business Model:**  
‚Çπ1L/month per project ‚Üí 10-20x ROI for customers

**Ask:**  
Raising ‚Çπ50L-1Cr ($60-120K) seed to hit ‚Çπ10.8 Cr ARR ($1.3M) in 12 months

**Why now?**  
AI is mature, market is ready, zero competition, strong builder network.

Would love 15 minutes to show you the product and share our go-to-market strategy.

**Pitch deck:** [Attach INVESTOR_PITCH.md or INVESTOR_ONE_PAGER.md]

Best,

## Tips for Sending:

1. **Personalize the first line:** "I saw you invested in [company] - BuilderOS is similar but for construction."

2. **Keep it SHORT:** Investors get 100+ emails/day. This email is already at the limit.

3. **Lead with traction:** "3 builder contacts lined up" = you have distribution

4. **Compare to YC companies:** Instantly gives you credibility

5. **Clear ask:** "‚Çπ50L-1Cr seed" - don't be vague

6. **Attach ONE document:** Either the full pitch (INVESTOR_PITCH.md) or one-pager (INVESTOR_ONE_PAGER.md), not both

7. **Follow up in 3-5 days** if no response

## Cold Outreach Tips:

**LinkedIn Message (if you don't have email):**

"Hi [Name], I'm building AI for Indian real estate developers (think Cursor for construction). We've validated the idea with 3 builders managing ‚Çπ500+ Cr projects. Similar to YC-funded Triplezip but with broader scope. Would love 15 mins to share our traction + roadmap. Can I send you a deck?"

**Twitter DM (if they're active):**

"Built AI that saves real estate builders ‚Çπ50L-2Cr/project. 3 customers lined up. Raising ‚Çπ50L-1Cr seed. Mind if I send a deck?"

## Red Flags to Avoid:

‚ùå "We're still validating the idea" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "3 builders committed to trials"  
‚ùå "We need funding to build the product" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "MVP deployed, raising for GTM"  
‚ùå "We're targeting all industries" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Laser-focused on Indian construction"  
‚ùå "No competition" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Similar to Triplezip (YC W24) but broader"  
‚ùå Vague financials ‚Üí ‚úÖ "‚Çπ1L/month per project, 10-20x ROI"
