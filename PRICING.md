## 🎯 SALES TALKING POINTS

### **For Sales Calls:**

**Opening:**
> "LegalOS is ₹10,000 per lawyer per month. Everything is included - unlimited AI, all features, priority support, 50 GB storage per lawyer. The ONLY time you pay more is if you need extra storage."

**When They Ask About AI Limits:**
> "Unlimited. No daily limits, no counting. Use it 10 times or 1,000 times - same price. Because your productivity shouldn't have a limit."

**When They Ask About Data Retention:**
> "Forever. We never delete your cases. Ever. Other legal software deletes after 7 years - we keep everything permanently, included in the base price."

**When They Compare to Clio:**
> "Clio charges $89/month (~₹7,500), gives you 10 GB storage, no AI, and US law. We charge ₹10,000, give you 50 GB storage (5x more), unlimited AI trained on Indian law, and include everything. Plus, if your lawyers save even 10 hours/month with our AI, that's worth ₹50,000+ in billable time."

**When They Ask About Storage:**
> "You get 50 GB per lawyer included. That's enough for most firms. If you're a heavy document firm - like if you handle a lot of real estate or M&A - you can upgrade to 200 GB for ₹2,000 more per lawyer. 90% of our firms stick with the base plan."

**Closing:**
> "Want to try it free for 14 days? No credit card required. See if your lawyers save 10+ hours in the first week."
